- This script takes a spreadsheet with two columns, the first column being the current paths and the second containing new paths.

- The output is an Excel file that pairs up new paths with the closest string match to the current path. 

- A recommended destination and a match score column will be added. The list is sorted ascending by match score so that the least likely to be the best match are at the top.
